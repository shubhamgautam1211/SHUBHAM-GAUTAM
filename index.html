                      for me pursuing this as a career option. CS field is so vast and each field of it has some beauty in it because each one of it has real life application and brings so much to table for the Tech Enthusiasts.
                      <br> <br>
                      "Graphic designing" and "Video Editing" are 2 fields which gives me immense fun and has a huge demand nowadays in the market for being a Freelancer and a content creator.
                      Best attribute about these 2 fields is the creativity they have deep inside them and my love for "graphics" can be clearly seen in the tagline if you know what i mean.
